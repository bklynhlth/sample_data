This folder contains audio files and JSON transcription files for a mock PANSS clinical interview. The interview is divided into three parts to facilitate replication due to longer data processing times for longer files. The .m4a here can be converted to .wav files and, along with the JSON files, run through OpenWillis to extract features related to speech characteristics and vocal acoustics for the mock participant.
